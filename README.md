To build and run this app you need to have

* Java JDK 6 [http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp]

* Ant 1.7 [http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi]

* Google App Engine SDK [http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html]

Either place the appengine-sdk two levels above this directory
or edit build.xml (line 2) to point to it.

Then do

ant runserver

That will compile everything and start the test server
running on port 8080.
